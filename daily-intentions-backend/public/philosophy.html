                <p style="font-size: 1.25rem; max-width: 700px; margin: 0 auto;">Setting intentions is a practice of aligning your actions with your values, moment by moment. It's about how you want to show up, not just what you want to achieve.</p>

                    <div class="content-section">
                        <h2>Intentions vs. Goals</h2>
                        <p>While goals and intentions both guide our actions, they serve different purposes and create different experiences.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Goals are about outcomes</h3>
                        <p>Goals focus on what you want to achieve—a destination, a result, a measurable outcome. Examples include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>"I want to lose 10 pounds"</li>
                            <li>"I want to get a promotion"</li>
                            <li>"I want to save $5,000"</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Goals are valuable for planning and direction, but they're future-oriented and can create pressure when outcomes feel out of reach.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Intentions are about how you show up</h3>
                        <p>Intentions focus on the present moment—how you want to be, the qualities you want to embody, the way you want to engage with life. Examples include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>"I choose to nourish my body with care"</li>
                            <li>"I approach my work with curiosity and presence"</li>
                            <li>"I make financial decisions aligned with my values"</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Intentions are about the journey, not just the destination. They're available to you right now, in this moment, regardless of external circumstances.</p>
                        
                        <div class="example-box">
                            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Instead of the goal "I want to lose 10 pounds," an intention might be "I choose to move my body with joy and nourish myself with foods that make me feel energized."</p>
                            <p>The intention focuses on the process and your relationship with yourself, while the goal focuses on a specific outcome.</p>
                        </div>
                        
                        <h3>Why intentions are more sustainable</h3>
                        <p>Intentions create a different kind of motivation. When you set an intention, you're committing to a way of being that you can practice immediately. This makes them:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>More accessible:</strong> You can practice your intention right now, without waiting for conditions to be perfect</li>
                            <li><strong>More flexible:</strong> Intentions adapt to changing circumstances, while goals can feel rigid</li>
                            <li><strong>More meaningful:</strong> They connect you to your values and sense of purpose</li>
                            <li><strong>Less stressful:</strong> There's no "failure" with intentions—only opportunities to return to your intention</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <div class="content-section">
                        <h2>Benefits of Daily Intentions</h2>
                        <p>Setting daily intentions creates a practice of mindful awareness that can transform how you experience your days. Here are some of the ways this practice supports well-being:</p>
                        
                        <h3>Present moment focus</h3>
                        <p>Daily intentions bring your attention to the here and now. Instead of getting lost in worries about the future or regrets about the past, intentions help you stay grounded in what's happening right now.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Greater self-awareness</h3>
                        <p>The practice of setting and reflecting on intentions increases your awareness of your patterns, reactions, and choices. You begin to notice when you're aligned with your intention and when you've drifted away.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Reduced stress and overwhelm</h3>
                        <p>When you have a clear intention for how you want to show up, decision-making becomes simpler. You can ask yourself: "Does this align with my intention?" This clarity reduces the mental load of constant choices.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Alignment with values</h3>
                        <p>Intentions help you live in alignment with what matters most to you. They're a bridge between your values and your daily actions, creating a sense of integrity and purpose.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Sustainable behavior change</h3>
                        <p>Because intentions focus on process rather than outcomes, they support lasting change. You're not just trying to achieve something—you're cultivating a way of being that becomes natural over time.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Mental clarity</h3>
                        <p>A clear intention acts like a compass, helping you navigate your day with purpose. When distractions arise, your intention reminds you of what matters most.</p>

                        <h2>The Practice</h2>
                        <p>Setting effective intentions is a skill that deepens with practice. Here's how to approach it:</p>
                        
                        <h3>How to set effective intentions</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Start with "I choose" or "I intend":</strong> This language empowers you and makes it clear this is your active choice</li>
                            <li><strong>Focus on qualities, not outcomes:</strong> Think about how you want to be, not what you want to achieve</li>
                            <li><strong>Keep it simple:</strong> One clear intention is more powerful than a long list</li>
                            <li><strong>Make it personal:</strong> Your intention should resonate with you and your current needs</li>
                            <li><strong>Be specific enough to be actionable:</strong> "I choose to be present" is good, but "I choose to be present in conversations" gives you a clearer focus</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Examples of daily intentions</h3>
                        <p>Here are some examples to inspire your own practice:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>"I choose to be present in conversations"</li>
                            <li>"I approach challenges with curiosity"</li>
                            <li>"I prioritize rest and renewal"</li>
                            <li>"I respond with patience instead of reacting"</li>
                            <li>"I move through my day with ease"</li>
                            <li>"I listen to my body's needs"</li>
                            <li>"I create space for creativity"</li>
                            <li>"I connect with others authentically"</li>
                        </ul>

                    <!-- Weekly & Monthly Intentions -->
                    <div class="content-section">
                        <h2>Weekly & Monthly Intentions</h2>
                        <p>While daily intentions create moment-to-moment awareness, weekly and monthly intentions provide broader themes and direction.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Daily intentions: micro-level awareness</h3>
                        <p>Daily intentions are your anchor to the present moment. They help you navigate each day with intention, making conscious choices aligned with how you want to show up. These are your most immediate, actionable intentions.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Weekly intentions: focused themes</h3>
                        <p>Weekly intentions create a theme for your week—a broader focus that your daily intentions can support. For example, if your weekly intention is "I choose to prioritize connection," your daily intentions might include "I reach out to a friend" or "I listen fully in conversations."</p>
                        
                        <h3>Monthly intentions: broader direction</h3>
                        <p>Monthly intentions provide a sense of direction for the month ahead. They're like a compass pointing toward what matters most during this period of your life. Your weekly and daily intentions then become the steps that move you in that direction.</p>
                        
                        <div class="example-box">
                            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
                            <p><strong>Monthly:</strong> "I choose to cultivate more balance between work and rest"</p>
                            <p><strong>Weekly:</strong> "I honor my boundaries around work hours"</p>
                            <p><strong>Daily:</strong> "I step away from my desk for lunch without my phone"</p>
                            <p>Each level supports the others, creating a cohesive practice that spans different time horizons.</p>
