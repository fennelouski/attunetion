    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: December 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Attunetion ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our mobile application.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <h3>2.1 Information You Provide</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User Profile Information:</strong> Any information you choose to share about yourself to personalize AI-generated intentions. This information is stored locally on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Intentions:</strong> The intentions you create, edit, or delete within the app.</li>
        <li><strong>Preferences:</strong> Your app settings, theme preferences, and notification preferences.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2 Information We Do NOT Collect</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>We do not collect personally identifiable information such as your name, email address, or phone number.</li>
        <li>We do not track your location.</li>
        <li>We do not access your contacts, photos, or other personal data stored on your device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <h3>3.1 Local Storage via iCloud</h3>
    <p>All your content stays in iCloud. Your data, including intentions, user profile information, and preferences, is stored locally on your device and automatically synced across your Apple devices using iCloud (powered by Apple's CloudKit and SwiftData). This data synchronization is managed entirely by Apple, and we do not have direct access to your iCloud data.</p>

    <h3>3.2 Suggestion Features and Third-Party Data Sharing</h3>
    <p>When you use features that generate suggestions for you (such as auto-suggested intentions, rephrasing, or personalized content), we may share your data with third-party services to provide these features. Specifically:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your user profile information and intention-related data may be sent to our backend service</li>
        <li>Our backend service uses OpenAI's API to generate personalized suggestions</li>
        <li>This information is sent only when you actively use suggestion features</li>
        <li>Your data is not stored on our servers</li>
        <li>Data sent to third parties is processed according to their privacy policies</li>
        <li>This data is used solely for generating your personalized suggestions</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> Before using any suggestion features, you will be asked to agree to our Terms of Service and End User License Agreement, which includes consent for sharing your data with third-party services for this specific purpose.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>Your data is stored locally on your device and synced via Apple's CloudKit. We do not maintain servers that store your personal information. Our backend API:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Does not store user profile information</li>
        <li>Does not store your intentions</li>
        <li>Only processes requests temporarily to generate AI responses</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We use the following third-party services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Third-Party Content Generation Services:</strong> When you use suggestion features, your data may be sent to third-party services (such as OpenAI) to generate personalized content. Your data is subject to the third-party provider's privacy policy when used for this purpose. You must agree to share your data with these services before using suggestion features.</li>
        <li><strong>Apple iCloud (CloudKit):</strong> For storing and syncing your data across your devices. Your data is subject to Apple's privacy policy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Access your data (stored locally on your device)</li>
        <li>Delete your data at any time through the app settings</li>
        <li>Disable AI-generated intentions at any time</li>
        <li>Stop using the app and delete it from your device</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>You can delete all your data at any time through the app's settings. Since we do not store your data on our servers, deleting data from the app removes it completely. If you have questions about data deletion, please contact us.</p>

    <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our app is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy.</p>

    <h2>10. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us through the app's support channels.</p>
